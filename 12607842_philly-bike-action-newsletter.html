Hello!

Welcome to the first email newsletter of Philly Bike Action!

Philly Bike Action! is a grassroots organization that recently got started in this wonderful city we call home. Our goal is to get people organized and involved locally in order to advocate for better bicycle infrastructure. Already this year, 7 people have died biking or using some sort of micromobility. This has got to change. Our city is so far off from the Vision Zero targets set a few years ago. Unless something is done, 2030 is going to look as bad as 2023 has been. This is all occurring in a background of worsening climate change and increasing costs of automobile ownership.

We believe better bicycle infrastructure is a solution to many of the problems our city will face in the coming years. Unfortunately, the Philadelphia city government is complex and opaque which can make advocacy seem daunting at times. It doesn't have to be so. We believe that knowledge about how the system works can inspire folks to take action. Knowing that one's actions will lead to results is a powerful motivator. We want to be a resource for that knowledge.

Monday we will be having our first meeting at the Schuylkill River park (west end of Spruce street) at 7pm. We will be meeting at the benches near the Figuresphere II sculpture tagged in the Google Map below. Since this is our first meeting, there is a lot we would like to discuss, most importantly the direction we would like to see the group go. We will be discussing bike rides, future meetups, short term goals, long term goals, bike-lane parking, RCOs and whatever else everyone wants to talk about. We will almost certainly get beer after for those who are interested. Please do attend! This first meeting will have a huge impact on the direction the group goes in the future.
